# Day 7 – Debugging JavaScript Code

This task focuses on understanding and fixing a small piece of broken JavaScript code.

The given code was intended to check whether a number is even or odd, but it had issues related to data types and conditional logic. By carefully reading the code, the errors were identified and corrected.

The fixed version converts the input into a number, checks if the value is valid, and then correctly determines whether it is even or odd.

This exercise helped improve my ability to read code, identify mistakes, and understand how small errors can affect program output.
